Q. Given a binary tree, a target and a replacement, replace all nodes with the target value with the replacement value

Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
function Tree(x) {
  this.value = x;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}
*/

function solution(root, target, replacement) {1
    const stack = root ? [root] : [];
    
    while (stack.length)

}
