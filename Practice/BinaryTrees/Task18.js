Q. Given a binary search tree, return the value of the violating node. When there is a violation, return the lowest node. If there is no violating node, return -1.

For example, in this tree:

      5
    /  \
  2    10
   \
    8
We have a violation between 5 and 8 because 8 is not less than 5. Because 8 is the lower node, return 8.

Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
function Tree(x) {
  this.value = x;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}
