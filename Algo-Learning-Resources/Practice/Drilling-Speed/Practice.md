# Instructions #
- Use this folder to practice drill and memorization. Divided into specific problems.
- Problem, data structure, and test cases are provided.
- For Core Algos / template drilling go to the Core-Algos.
- Any extra practice is in the '_MorePractice' folder. 
- For practice there is no "pre-set" return so no hints other than provided data structures.
- May also include some problems unrelated to the core algos.

# TIPS #
- Account for null cases.
- If using recursion (and should practice recursion)


# LINKED LIST PROBLEMS #
1.) Return the second to last element in a linked list
2.) Remove the last k elements from a LL
3.) Sum of last K elements in LL
4.) Return a copy of the last k elements in a LL.

# BINARY TREE PROBLEMS #
1.) Given a binary tree, count the number of elements with odd values in the tree.
2.) Given a binary tree, count the number of elements with negative values in the tree.
*3.) Given a binary tree, return the the maximum sum of nodes from the root to any leaf.
4.) Given a binary tree, count the numbers of unique elements in the tree.
5.) Given a binary tree, count the number of leaf nodes.
6.) Given a binary search tree, return the value of the violating node. 
7.) When there is a violation, return the lowest node. If there is no violating node, return -1.
