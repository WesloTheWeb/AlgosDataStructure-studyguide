QUESTION:
Given an array and a target value X, return an array of all indices containing value X.

##########
EXAMPLES
##########
console.log(indicesOfTarget([30,30,30], 30) == [0,1,2])
console.log(indicesOfTarget([3, 2, 5, 5, 1], 5) == [2,3])


Expected Questions
If you were presented with this question in an interview, these are some questions(s) you might want to ask:
Q. If the target does not appear in the original array, should I return an empty array?
A. Yes.
Q: Does the output order matter?
A: Yes and no. As long as every index is there only once, then that's fine. However, 
this problem should be done in the simplest way possible. What order will that put the output in?
