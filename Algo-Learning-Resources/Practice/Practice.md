# NOTE TO SELF
It does not make sense to copy *every* leetcode question onto here because:

1.) There is a dedicated github repo of *all* leetcode problems I ever solved.
2.) I have a notion.

Use this folder for good problems that highlights techniques and / or common. For algo marathon attempt practice
after failure use the algo-marathon folder.

# What it should be used for:
This folder instead should be used for problems that are not leetcode and are part of a ticket.
