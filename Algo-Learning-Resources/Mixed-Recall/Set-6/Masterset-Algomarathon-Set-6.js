LINKED LIST
Question 1:
Given two linked lists of equal length, sum elements' value at the same position.

Examples:
1. LL1: 1 -> 2, LL2: 3 -> 4
returns 4 -> 6

BINARY TREE
Question 2:
A tree is considered a binary search tree (BST) if for each of its nodes the following is true:
1.) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
2.) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3.) Both the left and the right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given a binary search tree t, find the kth smallest element in.

Note that the kth smallest element means kth element in increasing order, see examples for better understanding:

Examples:

! Note: Your solution should only have one BST traversal and O(1) extra space complexity, since this is what will be asked in an interview

function findkthSmallestElementInBST(t, k) {
