QUESTION:
Suppose you are given an edge list of all the members of a social network. This edge list contains tuples of the format,
(friend1, friend2)

All users of this social network exist in at least one tuple of this edge list. All users have unique name.

Return a boolean of whether two users are 2nd degree friends.

EXAMPLE:

user1 -- user2
  |        |
user3--user4--user5
  |_____________|

solution(edge_list, 'user1', 'user2') // false  
solution(edge_list, 'user1', 'user5') // true  

! NOTE: Whenever I have a chance and back to it, review this problem heavily along with graphs.
