Q. Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. THe objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and
each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Write an algorithm to check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

APPROACH:
 

PSEUDO CODE
 
NOTE:
There aren't that many patterns. Basically you should be able to iterate through a 2d array in a row-major way or a column-major way. 
More advanced would be moving through the matrix along other orderings (spiral, diagonals, etc).
But at the end of the day, it's all about:

Keeping track of two indices (row and column) in an organized matter.
Deciding how to move from one location to the next.
Dealing with the edges.
Deciding what work needs to be done at each visited location.
