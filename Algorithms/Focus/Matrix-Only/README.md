Literally do a Matrix problem a day I'm sick of this shit.

## NOTES
- Sometimes sub arrays have different length.
- Matrices are always a giant array with sub-arrays.

There aren't that many patterns. 
1. Basically you should be able to iterate through a 2d array in a row-major way or a column-major way. 

2. More advanced would be moving through the matrix along other orderings (spiral, diagonals, etc).

But at the end of the day, it's all about:
- Keeping track of two indices (row and column) in an organized matter.
- Deciding how to move from one location to the next.
- Dealing with the edges.
- Deciding what work needs to be done at each visited location.
