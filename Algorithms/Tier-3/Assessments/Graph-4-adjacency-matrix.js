QUESTION:
Given the adjacency matrix of the connected undirected graph with no loops or multiple edges, 
find the distance between the two specified vertices.

Example

For

matrix = [[false, false, true],
          [false, false, true],
          [true, true, false]]
vertex1 = 0, and vertex2 = 1, the output should be
solution(matrix, vertex1, vertex2) = 2.

Here's what the given graph looks like:

*/
function solution(matrix, vertex1, vertex2) {

}
