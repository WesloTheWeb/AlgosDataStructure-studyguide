# Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Counting frequencies: O(n)
- Creating array from Map: O(n)
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Final slice and map: O(k) which is O(n) worst case

# Space Complexity: O(n)
- countMap: O(n) unique elements
- arr: O(n) unique elements
- Final result: O(k) which is O(n) worst case

n: number of elements in input array
k: number of top frequent elements to return


##  Key steps:
1. Count frequencies using Map
2. Create [frequency, number] pairs
3. Sort pairs by frequency (descending)
4. Take top k elements and extract numbers

## Final step breakdown:
`arr.slice(0, k).map(pair => pair[1]);`
1. slice(0, k): Take top k frequent pairs
2. map(pair => pair[1]): Extract number from each pair
Result: Array of k most frequent numbers

# Frequency-Based Problem Solving Pattern

Count Frequencies

Use a hash map or Map object
Key: the element, Value: its frequency


Transform Data (if needed)

Create pairs, arrays, or other structures as required
Example: [frequency, element] pairs for easy sorting


Sort or Organize

Sort based on frequency
Use a heap for top K elements
Create buckets based on frequency


Extract Required Information

Slice, map, or iterate to get the final result
Often involves taking top K elements or filtering based on a condition



Remember: The specific implementation may vary, but this general pattern is applicable to many frequency-related problems!


### More about Array.from()
Use Cases in Algorithms and Interview Prep:

Converting Sets or Maps to Arrays:

Useful when you need to perform array operations after using a Set for deduplication or a Map for counting.


Creating Numeric Sequences:

Helpful for generating arrays of numbers, which is common in many algorithm problems.


String Manipulation:

Converting strings to arrays of characters for easier manipulation.


Custom Iterables:

If you implement custom data structures, Array.from() can be used to convert them to arrays.


Mapping and Transforming:

The mapping function in Array.from() can be useful for transforming data as you create an array.
