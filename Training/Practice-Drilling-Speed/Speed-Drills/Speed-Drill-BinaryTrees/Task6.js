Q. Given a binary tree, give all nodes that have only one child an additional child with the value of zero. For example, 
if a node has only a left child, add a right child with value zero. If a node has only a right child, add a left child 
with value zero.

Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
function Tree(x) {
  this.value = x;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}
*/

function solution(root) {

};
